Random Fourier Features
====

Python module of random fourier features (RFF) for regression and support vector machines [1].
Features of this RFF module is that interfaces of the module is quite close to the scikit-learn.
Also, this module needs scikit-learn as a backend of SVM solver.

Now this module only has a module for classification (RandomFourierFeatures.SVC),
however I will provide other SVM functions soon.


## Requirement

- Python 3.6.6
- Numpy 1.13.3
- Scipy 0.19.1
- scikit-learn 0.19.1


## Minimal example

Regression and support vector classification is implemented in source/PyRFF.py
and usage of the classes provided by this module is quite close to Scikit-learn.
For example, the following Python code is a sample usage of RFF regression class:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import PyRFF as pyrff
    >>> X = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4]])
    >>> y = X**2
    >>> reg = pyrff.RFFRegression().fit(X, y)
    >>> reg.score(X, y)
    1.0
    >>> reg.predict(np.array([[1.5]]))
    array([[ 2.25415897]])

See example/ directory for more detailed examples.

## MNIST using RFF and SVM

I tried MNIST which is a famous benchmark dataset for classification task using SVM with RFF,
and I've got a better performance and much faster inference speed than kernel SVM.
The following table gives a brief comparison of kernel SVM and SVM with RFF.
See [the example of RFFSVC mofule](https://github.com/tiskw/RandomFourierFeatures/blob/master/examples/rff_svc_for_mnist/README.md) for mode details.

| Method                   | Inference time (us) | Score (%) |
| :---------------------:  | :-----------------: | :-------: |
| Kernel SVM               | 4644.9 us           | 96.3 %    |
| SVM w/ RFF <br> d = 512  | 39.0 us             | 96.5 %    |
| SVM w/ RFF <br> d = 1024 | 96.1 us             | 97.5 %    |
